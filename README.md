# 2D Eulerian Fluid Simulation

![Fluid Flow Simulation](./assets/evolution.gif)

This project simulates the flow of a two-dimensional incompressible fluid using the Eulerian approach and finite difference methods. The simulation is based on the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid substances. For this demonstration, we assume:

1. The fluid is Newtonian, meaning viscosity is constant.
2. The fluid is incompressible, so density remains constant.
3. The fluid is isothermal, making temperature irrelevant.
4. No external forces are applied.
5. The system is two-dimensional.
6. The fluid is contained in a box where all walls have no velocity, except for the top wall, which moves.
